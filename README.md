# vinote

## Description
Vinote is a notion-like note taking system, the main feature of which is  the
tree-like structure of notes, customizability and heavy use of keyboard.  

Here one note can contain another one, which can be a more detailed explanation  
of some point in the parent one, or the parent one can be a list of the child  
notes with a short description etc.  

This feature gives a lot of flexibility in organizing notes. Here you can  
create a non-graphical mindmap which is a lot more convenient to read despite  
its size.  

It's made as a plugin for Neovim text editor, so at least basic knowledge of vim  
is required.  

## How to use
At first, in the shell type `note`.

At the first use it opens your root note, which is empty by default. To add a  
new note insert \*note_name\* where note_name is the name of the new  
note. (see `_` file in the root of the repository)  

To go to the new note move the cursor to its name and type `ef`.  
This command throws you to the new empty note.  

To go back to the root note type `eu`. The other ways to do that are `eh` (go  
home) and `eb` (go back by history).  

To move, rename or create a link to a note you should choose it first. Move  
the cursor to the name of the note and type `ec`.

To move it go somewhere else, type the name of the note in the form as mentioned  
before, move the cursor on it, and type `en`.  

To rename it do the same, but within the same note.  

To create a link type the name of the link, move the cursor on it, and type  
`el`.  

To search through notes recursively type `esn`, type the keyword, then choose the  
right result and press `Enter`. It will move you to the choosen note.  

To remove a note move the cursor on it and type `er`, and now you can delete its  
name, since the note doesn't exist anymore.  

## How to install

```
git clone https://github.com/dimarogiv/vinote/vinote.git

```
When asks for password enter your password for `sudo`.

Now, to launch it type `note` on the command line.
